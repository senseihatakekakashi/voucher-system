## Laravel Voucher Code Management System - README.md

### Introduction

This Laravel-based web application helps you manage voucher codes, user groups, and permissions. Create, assign, and export voucher codes, and manage users with different roles and group memberships.

### Features

* **Voucher Code Management:**
  * Create and manage unique voucher codes.
  * Assign voucher codes to specific users.

* **User and Group Management:**
  * Manage individual users and their assigned roles.
  * Organize users into groups for easier management.

* **Administrator Roles:**
  * Super Admins have full access and control.
  * Group Admins have limited access based on assigned groups.

### Requirements

* PHP >= 7.4
* Laravel >= 8.x
* Composer
* MySQL or SQLite

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/senseihatakekakashi/voucher-system.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**

   ```bash
   cd voucher-code-management
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

4. **Configure .env file:**

   * Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
   * Run `php artisan key:generate` to set a secret key.
   * Update the `.env` file with your database connection details and other application settings.

5. **Set up the database:**

   * Create your database and update the database configuration in `.env`.

   **DB ENV Setup [optional]**
   You can also use SQLite to test this application. Using this config, upon `artisan:migration`, Laravel will create the SQLite db inside the project folder.

   ```env
   DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_DATABASE=voucher_system_db
   DB_USERNAME=root
   DB_PASSWORD=
   ```

   If encountering an error path not found, copy the absolute path from the SQLite db generated by Laravel and replace `DB_DATABASE` with its value.

   Example: `C:/user/folder/voucher_system/voucher_system_db`

   ```env
   DB_DATABASE=<absolute_path_to_laravel_sqlite_generated_db>
   ```

6. **Run migrations:**

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

7. **Start the development server:**

   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

### Configuration

1. **Environment Variables:**
   Set database connection details and other settings in the `.env` file.

### Usage

1. Access the application in your web browser.
2. Log in with appropriate credentials.
3. Explore the dashboard to manage voucher codes, users, and groups.

### Test User Credentials Based on the User Seeder

**Super Admin**
- **Name:** Super Admin

   - **Email:** group.admin1@email.com
   - **Password:** password

2. 
   - **Name:** [Random Name]

   - **Password:** password

3. 
   - **Name:** [Random Name]
   - **Email:** group.admin3@email.com
   - **Password:** password

### Mail Configuration

This document covers email configuration for the application, focusing on development and testing using Mailtrap.

**Requirements:**

* Mailtrap account (free tier works for testing)

**Configuration:**

Update the following environment variables in your `.env` file:

```env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=smtp.mailtrap.io
MAIL_PORT=2525
MAIL_USERNAME=mailtrap-username
MAIL_PASSWORD=mailtrap-password
MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=null
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS=(put your own email here)
MAIL_FROM_NAME="${APP_NAME}"
```

**Important:**

* **Replace** `mailtrap-username` and `mailtrap-password` with your actual Mailtrap credentials.
* **Set your own email address** in `MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS`.
* Update `MAIL_FROM_NAME` with your application's name.

**Testing:**

1. **Verify configuration:** Ensure the above settings are correct for your development environment.
2. **Register user:** Create a new user to test the welcome email functionality.
3. **Check inbox:** Access your Mailtrap inbox and confirm that the welcome email was sent and received successfully.

**Additional Notes:**

* This configuration is recommended for testing purposes only.
* For production environments, consult your chosen email provider for specific configuration details.
* Consider implementing security measures like sender domain verification for production setups.
